<p>In the sidebar you can set the following:<br />1. <strong>Number of subjects per group</strong>: with this you set the sample size of the study. Varying this option you can study how the sample size influence the precision of parameter estimation like the effect size</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.<strong>Mean of outcome variable (y) in control group. </strong>With this option you set the expected mean in the control group. In term of linear model this is to set the intercept coefficient&nbsp;<span style="font-family: symbol;">a .<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;"> You can set any value you can guess.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
