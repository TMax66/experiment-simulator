<p>This app is for educational purposes. It allows to simulate an experimental study with two treatment groups (as control vs treatment) and a continuous outcome variable (y).</p>
<p>In the sidebar you can set the following:</p>
<p><br /><strong>1. Number of subjects per group:</strong> with this you set the sample size of the study. Varying this option you can study how the sample size influence the precision of parameter estimation like the effect size</p>
<p><strong>2.Mean of outcome variable (y) in control group:</strong>&nbsp;With this option you set the expected mean in the control group. In term of linear model this is to set the intercept coefficient a. You can set any number you can guess positive as well negative values.</p>
<p><strong>3. Effect size:</strong> with this option you set the expexted difference between hypotetical control and treatment group. Varing it you can explore the relationship among sample size and variability and how this influences the 'statistical significativity' according to a NHST approach. In terms of linear model this correspond to b coefficient.</p>
<p><strong>4. Standard deviation of outcome variability (y):</strong>&nbsp;This set the varibility of y&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use this app it's very simple. After set the values of differents option in sidebar, go to&nbsp; "Run experiment" tab. Click the button and the app will genere to a dataset, with the number the subjects you input the y generated by a linear model using your input value and the group factor. App will show you two plot. A boxplot that describe the variability of y in the differen group and a forest plot that plot point and 95%CI estimate of intercept (mean of y in control group) and the effect size (Beta coefficient). Finally a descripitive table for the two gruop is print as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time you push the "Run experiment" the app will&nbsp;</p>
