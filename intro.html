<p>This app is for educational purposes. It allows to simulate an experimental study with two treatment groups (as control vs treatment) and a continuous outcome variable (y).</p>
<p>In the sidebar you can set the following:</p>
<p><br />1. Number of subjects per group: with this you set the sample size of the study. Varying this option you can study how the sample size influence the precision of parameter estimation like the effect size</p>
<p>2.Mean of outcome variable (y) in control group: With this option you set the expected mean in the control group. In term of linear model this is to set the intercept coefficient alpha. You can set any number you can guess positive as well negative values.</p>
<p>3. Effect size: with this option you set the expexted difference between hypotetical control and treatment group. Varing it you can explore the relationship among sample size and variability and how this influences the 'statistical significance' according to a NHST approach. In terms of linear model this correspond to beta coefficient.</p>
<p>4. Standard deviation of outcome variability (y): This set the variability of y</p>

<p>Using this app it's very simple. After set the values of differents option in sidebar, go to "Run experiment" tab. Click the button and the app will generate to a dataset, with the number the subjects you input, the y generated by a linear model using your input value,&nbsp; and the group factor. The app will show you two plot. A boxplot that describe the variability of y in the different groups and a forest plot that plot point and 95%CI estimate of intercept (mean of y in control group) and the effect size (beta coefficient). Finally a descripitive table for the two group is print as well.</p>
<p>Every time you push the "Run experiment" button with the same set of options, the app will generete a new experiment, so you can appreciate how the variability of y influcences the results of experiment.</p>
<p>In the Simulate N experiment tab you can experiment the meaning of the frequentist concept of probability based "on the long run experiment". Infact you can simulate 10-100-1000 and whatever number of experiments (using the set of options in the sidebar), that you want. The app will run the number of the experiments that you set and it will show you a plot with the density distribution of the possible point estimation of effect size you can get, a forest plot with the point and 95%CI estimation of effect size, and an histogram with the distribution of the pvalue, associated at each simulated&nbsp;experiment.&nbsp;</p>
